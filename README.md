# Bookmark For YouTube™

Tired of losing your place in a long YouTube video? Bookmark For YouTube™ automatically keeps track of where you left off in a video, and restores it the next time you visist the video page.

This extension is currently in development. It is available for Firefox at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-for-youtube/.
